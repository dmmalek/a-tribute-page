          <h2>Father Of Bengali Nation</h2>
          <p class="a-description">
            <b>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b>[c] (17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975),
            popularly known by the honorific prefix Bangabandhu[d] (lit. 'Friend
            of Bengal') was a Bengali politician, revolutionary, statesman,
            activist and diarist, who served as the President of Bangladesh from
            April 1971 to January 1972 and again from January 1975 till his
            assassination in August 1975, and Prime Minister from January 1972
            to January 1975.Mujib successfully led the Bangladeshi independence
            movement and restored the Bengali sovereignty after over two
            centuries following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, for which he is
            honoured as the 'Father of the Nation' in Bangladesh.[7] In 2011,
            the fifteenth constitutional amendment in Bangladesh referred to
            Sheikh Mujib as the Father of the Nation who declared independence;
            these references were enshrined in the fifth, sixth, and seventh
            schedules of the constitution.[8] His Bengali nationalist ideology,
            socio-political theories, and political doctrines are sometimes
            called Mujibism.
